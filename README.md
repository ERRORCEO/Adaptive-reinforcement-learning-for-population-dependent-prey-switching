### Adaptive-reinforcement-learning-for-population-dependent-prey-switching
Abstract: There are a variety of food resources available to an animal in its environment. Lotka–Volterra prey-predator system is a well-known model to study the dynamics of an animal interacting with its food. In this report, I study the adaptiveness of predator switching between two prey species based on the population of the prey. I use a two-prey one predator dynamical system with parameters leading to Hopf-Bifurcation and pass the output which is the population of both prey at time t as an input to the reinforcement learning model to learn which prey to select. The reinforcement model converges to the optimal solution and it is capable of adaptive learning if the population of one prey increases in any time step compared to the other prey species.
